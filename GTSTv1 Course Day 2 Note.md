# History of Linux

### ● In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer,
### ● which was chosen mainly because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it
### ● BUT IT WASN’T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE
### ● Then Person called “LINUS TORVALDS” Created the Linux kernel. And posted it online to make it open-source.

# Cont…
### ● Richard Stallman announced the GNU project in 1983 and cofounded the Free Software Foundation in 1985.
### ● GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS, But it was just software replacement not full os {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .
### ● So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
### ● The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed

# What is Shell?
### ● Users communicate with the kernel by the shell.
### ● The Shell is a Command Line Interpreter. It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel.

# Types of shells
## ● Based on their features there are money shells.
### ○ SH
### ○ BASH
### ○ ZSH
### ○ FISH
### They differ in Colouring,Piping,command compilation, some kind of features.
### - TO IDENTIFY YOUR SHELL “echo $SHELL”

# Linux distributions/distro

## ● Distro is Modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different:

### -Linux Kerner
### -Packages (GNU)
### -Package Manager
### -Desktop UI

# Do windows have distros?
## ● Windows is not open-source so peoples won’t use / edit it, so there won’t be other kind.
